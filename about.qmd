title: "About me"
---


- I am an intern at [Datacation](https://www.datacation.nl/en/) where I fulfill duties of a Data Science Consultant.

- Currently work on a predictive model for public tenders on [TenderNed](https://www.tenderned.nl/cms/en/english/tenderned-dutch-governments-online-tendering-system). The goal is to estimate the probability of winning a tender based on historical data and your bid.

- I am passionate about predictive models and, since recently, web scraping. You can check out my recent project [here](https://adamwadolowski.github.io/spotify-playlists-EDA/).

- I am in the final year of my Bachelor in Econometrics at the [Erasmus University Rotterdam](https://www.eur.nl/en).
