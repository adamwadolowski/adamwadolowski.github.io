- I am an intern at [Datacation](https://www.datacation.nl/en/) where I fulfill duties of a Data Science Consultant.

- I work with [HERAS](https://export.heras.com/) on predicting the time of components' failure in their products to prevent disruptions in their services.

- I am passionate about predictive models and, since recently, webscraping. You can check out my webscraping project [here](https://adamwadolowski.github.io/spotify-playlists-EDA/).

- I am in the final year of my Bachelor in Econometrics at the [Erasmus University Rotterdam](https://www.eur.nl/en).
